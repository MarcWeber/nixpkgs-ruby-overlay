You also have to checkout nixpkgs-ruby-overlay-specs beneath this directory

gem puligin creating the dump [1]:

Run it this way:

install simpleEnv
ruby-env-simple gem nixpkgsoverlay $TARGET

where $TARGET is a checkout of nixpkgs-ruby-overlay-specs [2] because it contais a
huge files with fetched hashes.

Of course you can refetch everything from scratch but it'll take several hours
